In my HTML file you will find two main section tags. The left side container is wrap in a main tag to act as the flex parent for all of the boxes. I also used this method to correctly space out my boxes and the whole left side in relation to the right side.

In my CSS folder you will find all of my styled elements. I also used CSS to plug in my Bey background picture.
